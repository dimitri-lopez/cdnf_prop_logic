Automated Propositional Logic Equivalence Prover

* Project Idea
From Bram:

#+begin_quote
Automated Equivalence Prover: Implement the algorithm we discussed in class that
was used to demonstrate that any two equivalent statements in propositional
logic can be transformed into each other using basic equivalence principles.
Make output in .bram format so it can be loaded and displayed in Aris - Dimitri

We are essentially just creating a truth table with a special ordering and then
creating the CDNF from that.

* Notes
** Overview of Algorithm
We are following the algorithm described by Bram in
[[./references/systems_of_equivalence.pdf]] to show that two statements are
equivalent. We convert two sentences into CDNF(A, B) which is the Disjunctive
Normal Form (DNF) of A and B except that using the algorithm on hand we have
some standardized form of it.

In particular see page 4.

1. Gather the atomic sentences occuring in A and B
2. This yields us a set of atomic sentences. If there is no atomic sentences then
   we either have a tautology or a contradiction.
3. Create a truth table. Let the reference columns be the atomic sentences on
   hand.
4. Sort the reference columns / atomic sentences by some defined order. We are
   aiming for consistency here.
5. Work out the truth-conditions for A.
6. For every true row, conjunct all the literals together giving us a statement.
   If there are no true rows, then we have a contradiction.
7. Disjunct all of these statements together.
8. This yields us CDNF(A, B). Now check if CDNF(A, B) = CDNF(B, A). This
   reflects if A <==> B.
** Ideas
- Converting to DNF can definitely be done by applying algebraic operations
  - I think this may be faster than the truth table method.
  - Complexity analysis of both algorithms will need to be done.
- Complexity analysis of table method
  - The size of the table is exponential with the number of unique atomic
    literals.
